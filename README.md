# Olympic Games Analysis (1896â€“2016)

This project explores **120 years of Olympic history** â€” from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 â€” to uncover trends in athlete performance, national dominance, gender participation, and the impact of hosting the Games. Using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **interactive visualizations**, this analysis provides key insights for sports analysts and federations.
